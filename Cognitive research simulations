Cognitive research simulations involve the use of computer-based models or simulated environments to study various aspects of cognitive processes. These simulations perceive, process, and respond to information. Here are some common types of 
conginitive research simulations : 

1. Virtual reality simulations -
Spatial navigation : Studying how individuals navigate and orient themselves in virtual environments, providing insights into spatial memory and cognitive mapping.

Social interaction : Simulating social scenarios to investigate social cognition, interpersonal communication, and the impact of virtual social cues on behavior. 

2. Cognitive training games -
Memory training : developing games and simulations to assess and enhance memory functions, including working memory, episodic memory, and spatial memory.
